			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good&#8209;morning," Mr. Button said, nervously, to the clerk in the Chesapeake
			Dry Goods Company. "I want to buy some clothes for my child."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"How old is your child, sir?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"About six hours," answered Mr. Button, without due consideration.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Babies' supply department in the rear."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Why, I don't think&#8209;I'm not sure that's what I want. It's&#8209;he's an
			unusually large&#8209;size child. Exceptionally&#8209;ah&#8209;large."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"They have the largest child's sizes."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Where is the boys' department?" inquired Mr. Button, shifting his
			ground desperately. He felt that the clerk must surely scent his shameful
			secret.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Right here."<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well&#8209;" He hesitated. The notion of dressing his son in men's clothes
			was repugnant to him. If, say, he could only find a very large boy's suit,
			he might cut off that long and awful beard, dye the white hair brown,
			and thus manage to conceal the worst, </p>
			<p class="yellowright"> 
			and to retain something of his
			own self&#8209;respect&#8209;not to mention his position in Baltimore society.
			But a frantic inspection of the boys' department revealed no suits to fit
			the new&#8209;born Button. He blamed the store, of course&#8209;in such cases it is
			the thing to blame the store.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"How old did you say that boy of yours was?" demanded the clerk
			curiously.,<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"He's&#8209;sixteen."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought you said six hours. You'll find the
			youths' department in the next aisle."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Button turned miserably away. Then he stopped, brightened, and
			pointed his finger toward a dressed dummy in the window display.
			"There!" he exclaimed. "I'll take that suit, out there on the dummy."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The clerk stared. "Why," he protested, "that's not a child's suit. At least
			it is, but it's for fancy dress. You could wear it yourself!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Wrap it up," insisted his customer nervously. "That's what I want."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The astonished clerk obeyed.<br/>
