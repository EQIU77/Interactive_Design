			&nbsp; &nbsp; Hildegarde, waving a large silk flag, greeted him on the porch, and even
			as he kissed her he felt with a sinking of the heart that these three years
			had taken their toll. She was a woman of forty now, with a faint skirmish
			line of gray hairs in her head. The sight depressed him.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Up in his room he saw his reflection in the familiar mirror&amp;he went
			closer and examined his own face with anxiety, comparing it after a moment
			with a photograph of himself in uniform taken just before the war.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Good Lord!" he said aloud. The process was continuing. There was no
			doubt of itâ€”he looked now like a man of thirty. Instead of being delighted,
			he was uneasy&#8209;he was growing younger. He had hitherto
			hoped that once he reached a bodily age equivalent to his age in years,
			the grotesque phenomenon which had marked his birth would cease to
			function. He shuddered. His destiny seemed to him awful, incredible. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;When he came downstairs Hildegarde was waiting for him. She appeared
			annoyed, and he wondered if she had at last discovered that
			there was something amiss. It was with an effort to relieve the tension
			between them that he broached the matter at dinner in what he considered
			a delicate way.

			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," he remarked lightly, "everybody says I look younger than
			ever."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Hildegarde regarded him with scorn. She sniffed. "Do you think it's
			anything to boast about?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm not boasting," he asserted uncomfortably.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;She sniffed again. "The idea," she said, and after a moment: "I should
			think you'd have enough pride to stop it."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"How can I?" he demanded.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm not going to argue with you," she retorted. "But there's a right
			way of doing things and a wrong way. If you've made up your mind to
			be different from everybody else, I don't suppose I can stop you, but I
			really don't think it's very considerate."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"But, Hildegarde, I can't help it."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"You can too. You're simply stubborn. You think you don't want to be
			like any one else. You always have been that way, and you always will
			be. But just think how it would be if every one else looked at things as
			you do&#8209;what would the world be like?"
