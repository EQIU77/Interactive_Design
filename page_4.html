			<p class="yellow"> What horrible mishap had occurred? He had suddenly
			lost all desire to go into the Maryland Private Hospital for Ladies and
			Gentlemen. It was with the greatest difficulty that, a moment later, he
			forced himself to mount the steps and enter the front door. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; A nurse was sitting behind a desk in the opaque gloom of the hall.
			Swallowing his shame, Mr. Button approached her. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Good-morning," she remarked, looking up at him pleasantly.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Good-morning. I&#8209;I am Mr. Button."<br/>

			</p>
			<p class="yellowright"> &nbsp; &nbsp; At this a look of utter terror spread itself over the girl's face. She rose
			to her feet and seemed about to fly from the hall, restraining herself only
			with the most apparent difficulty.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I want to see my child," said Mr. Button.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The nurse gave a little scream. "Oh&#8209;of course!" she cried hysterically.
			"Up&#8209;stairs. Right up&#8209;stairs. Go&#8209;up!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;She pointed the direction, and Mr. Button, bathed in a cool perspiration,
			turned falteringly, and began to mount to the second floor. In the
			upper hall he addressed another nurse who approached him, basin in
			hand. "I'm Mr. Button," he managed to articulate.
