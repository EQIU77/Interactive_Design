			&nbsp; &nbsp; Hildegarde, waving a large silk flag, greeted him on the porch, and even
			as he kissed her he felt with a sinking of the heart that these three years
			had taken their toll. She was a woman of forty now, with a faint skirmish
			line of gray hairs in her head. The sight depressed him.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Up in his room he saw his reflection in the familiar mirror—he went
			closer and examined his own face with anxiety, comparing it after a moment
			with a photograph of himself in uniform taken just before the war.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Good Lord!" he said aloud. The process was continuing. There was no
			doubt of it—he looked now like a man of thirty. Instead of being delighted,
			he was uneasy—he was growing younger. He had hitherto
			hoped that once he reached a bodily age equivalent to his age in years,
			the grotesque phenomenon which had marked his birth would cease to
			function. He shuddered. His destiny seemed to him awful, incredible.
			He was admitted, and almost immediately attained a prominent position
			in the class, partly because he seemed a little older than the other
			freshmen, whose average age was about eighteen.
			But his success was largely due to the fact that in the football game
			with Yale he played so brilliantly, with so much dash and with such a
			cold, remorseless anger that he scored seven touchdowns and fourteen
			field goals for Harvard, and caused one entire eleven of Yale men to be
			carried singly from the field, unconscious. He was the most celebrated
			man in college.

			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp;Strange to say, in his third or junior year he was scarcely able to
			"make" the team. The coaches said that he had lost weight, and it seemed
			to the more observant among them that he was not quite as tall as before.
			He made no touchdowns—indeed, he was retained on the team chiefly
			in hope that his enormous reputation would bring terror and disorganisation
			to the Yale team.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;In his senior year he did not make the team at all. He had grown so
			slight and frail that one day he was taken by some sophomores for a
			freshman, an incident which humiliated him terribly. He became known
			as something of a prodigy&#8209;a senior who was surely no more than sixteen &#8209;
			and he was often shocked at the worldliness of some of his classmates.
			His studies seemed harder to him—he felt that they were too advanced.
			He had heard his classmates speak of St. Midas', the famous preparatory
			school, at which so many of them had prepared for college, and
			he determined after his graduation to enter himself at St. Midas', where
			the sheltered life among boys his own size would be more congenial to
			him.
