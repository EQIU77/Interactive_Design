				&nbsp; &nbsp; In 1880 Benjamin Button was twenty years old, and he signalised his
				birthday by going to work for his father in Roger Button&amp;Co., Wholesale
				Hardware. It was in that same year that he began "going out socially"&#8209;
				that is, his father insisted on taking him to several fashionable
				dances. Roger Button was now fifty, and he and his son were more and
				more companionable&#8209;in fact, since Benjamin had ceased to dye his hair
				(which was still grayish) they appeared about the same age, and could
				have passed for brothers.way, and repeated

				<br/>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;One night in August they got into the phaeton attired in their fulldress
				suits and drove out to a dance at the Shevlins' country house, situated
				just outside of Baltimore. It was a gorgeous evening. A full moon
				drenched the road to the lustreless colour of platinum, and late&#8209;blooming
				harvest flowers breathed into the motionless air aromas that were
				like low, half&#8209;heard laughter. The open country, carpeted for rods
				around with bright wheat, was translucent as in the day. It was almost
				impossible not to be affected by the sheer beauty of the sky&#8209;almost.
				<br/>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;"There's a great future in the dry&#8209;goods business," Roger Button was
				saying. He was not a spiritual man&#8209;his aesthetic sense was
				rudimentary.<br/>

				&nbsp; &nbsp;"Old fellows like me can't learn new tricks," he observed profoundly.
				"It's you youngsters with energy and vitality that have the great future
				before you."<br/>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;Far up the road the lights of the Shevlins' country house drifted into
				view, and presently there was a sighing sound that crept persistently toward
				themâ€”it might have been the fine plaint of violins or the rustle of
				the silver wheat under the moon.<br/>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;They pulled up behind a handsome brougham whose passengers were
				disembarking at the door. A lady got out, then an elderly gentleman,
				then another young lady, beautiful as sin. Benjamin started; an almost
				chemical change seemed to dissolve and recompose the very elements of
				his body. A rigour passed over him, blood rose into his cheeks, his forehead,
				and there was a steady thumping in his ears. It was first love.<br/>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;The girl was slender and frail, with hair that was ashen under the
				moon and honey&#8209;coloured under the sputtering gas&#8209;lamps of the porch.
				Over her shoulders was thrown a Spanish mantilla of softest yellow, butterflied
				in black; her feet were glittering buttons at the hem of her
				bustled dress.<br/>
