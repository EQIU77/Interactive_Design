			&nbsp; &nbsp; When, six months later, the engagement of Miss Hildegarde Moncrief to
Mr. Benjamin Button was made known (I say "made known," for General
Moncrief declared he would rather fall upon his sword than announce
it), the excitement in Baltimore society reached a feverish pitch. The almost
forgotten story of Benjamin's birth was remembered and sent out
upon the winds of scandal in picaresque and incredible forms. It was
said that Benjamin was really the father of Roger Button, that he was his
brother who had been in prison for forty years, that he was John Wilkes
Booth in disguise&#8209;and, finally, that he had two small conical horns
sprouting from his head.

			&nbsp; &nbsp;The Sunday supplements of the New York papers played up the case
with fascinating sketches which showed the head of Benjamin Button attached
to a fish, to a snake, and, finally, to a body of solid brass. He became
known, journalistically, as the Mystery Man of Maryland. But the
true story, as is usually the case, had a very small circulation.

&nbsp; &nbsp;However, every one agreed with General Moncrief that it was
"criminal" for a lovely girl who could have married any beau in Baltimore
to throw herself into the arms of a man who was assuredly fifty.
In vain Mr. Roger Button published his son's birth certificate in large
type in the Baltimore Blaze. No one believed it. You had only to look at
Benjamin and see.<br/>


			&nbsp; &nbsp;On the part of the two people most concerned there was no wavering.
So many of the stories about her fiancé were false that Hildegarde refused
stubbornly to believe even the true one. In vain General Moncrief
pointed out to her the high mortality among men of fifty—or, at least,
among men who looked fifty; in vain he told her of the instability of the
wholesale hardware business. Hildegarde had chosen to marry for mellowness,
and marry she did… .<br/>
