			&nbsp; &nbsp; Benjamin's discontent waxed stronger. At the outbreak of the Spanish-
American War in 1898 his home had for him so little charm that he decided
to join the army. With his business influence he obtained a commission
as captain, and proved so adaptable to the work that he was
made a major, and finally a lieutenant&#8209;colonel just in time to participate
in the celebrated charge up San Juan Hill. He was slightly wounded, and
received a medal.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin had become so attached to the activity and excitement of
army life that he regretted to give it up, but his business required attention,
so he resigned his commission and came home. He was met at the
station by a brass band and escorted to his house.
