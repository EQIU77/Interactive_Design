			&nbsp; &nbsp; As this was an inane and unanswerable argument Benjamin made no
reply, and from that time on a chasm began to widen between them. He
wondered what possible fascination she had ever exercised over him.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;To add to the breach, he found, as the new century gathered headway,
that his thirst for gayety grew stronger. Never a party of any kind in the
city of Baltimore but he was there, dancing with the prettiest of the
young married women, chatting with the most popular of the debutantes,
and finding their company charming, while his wife, a dowager
of evil omen, sat among the chaperons, now in haughty disapproval,
and now following him with solemn, puzzled, and reproachful eyes.<br/>

			&nbsp; &nbsp;His social activities, of course, interfered to some extent with his business,
but then he had worked hard at wholesale hardware for twentyfive
years and felt that he could soon hand it on to his son, Roscoe, who
had recently graduated from Harvard.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;He and his son were, in fact, often mistaken for each other. This
pleased Benjamin—he soon forgot the insidious fear which had come
over him on his return from the Spanish&#8209;American War, and grew to
take a naïve pleasure in his appearance. There was only one fly in the delicious
ointment&#8209;he hated to appear in public with his wife. Hildegarde
was almost fifty, and the sight of her made him feel absurd… .
