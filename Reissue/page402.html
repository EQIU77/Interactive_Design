			&nbsp; &nbsp; Benjamin Button walked with dignity from the room, and half a dozen
			undergraduates, who were waiting in the hall, followed him curiously
			with their eyes. When he had gone a little way he turned around, faced
			the infuriated registrar, who was still standing in the door&#8209;way, and repeated
			in a firm voice: "I am eighteen years old."
			<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;To a chorus of titters which went up from the group of undergraduates,
			Benjamin walked away.&#8209;
			<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;But he was not fated to escape so easily. On his melancholy walk to the
			railroad station he found that he was being followed by a group, then by
			a swarm, and finally by a dense mass of undergraduates. The word had
			gone around that a lunatic had passed the entrance examinations for
			Yale and attempted to palm himself off as a youth of eighteen. A fever of
			excitement permeated the college. Men ran hatless out of classes, the
			football team abandoned its practice and joined the mob, professors'
			wives with bonnets awry and bustles out of position, ran shouting after
			the procession, from which proceeded a continual succession of remarks
			aimed at the tender sensibilities of Benjamin Button.<br/>

			&nbsp; &nbsp;"He must be the wandering Jew!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"He ought to go to prep school at his age!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Look at the infant prodigy!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"He thought this was the old men's home."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Go up to Harvard!"<br/>

			&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin increased his gait, and soon he was running. He would show
			them! He would go to Harvard, and then they would regret these ill&#8209;considered
			taunts!<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Safely on board the train for Baltimore, he put his head from the window.
			"You'll regret this!" he shouted.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Ha&#8209;ha!" the undergraduates laughed. "Ha&#8209;ha&#8209;ha!" It was the biggest
			mistake that Yale College had ever madeâ€¦ .<br/>
