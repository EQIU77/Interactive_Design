			&nbsp; &nbsp; In one particular, at least, the friends of Hildegarde Moncrief were mistaken.
			The wholesale hardware business prospered amazingly. In the fifteen
			years between Benjamin Button's marriage in 1880 and his father's
			retirement in 1895, the family fortune was doubledâ€”and this was due
			largely to the younger member of the firm.
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Needless to say, Baltimore eventually received the couple to its bosom.
			Even old General Moncrief became reconciled to his son&#8209;in&#8209;law when
			Benjamin gave him the money to bring out his "History of the Civil War"
			in twenty volumes, which had been refused by nine prominent
			publishers.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;In Benjamin himself fifteen years had wrought many changes. It
			seemed to him that the blood flowed with new vigor through his veins.
			It began to be a pleasure to rise in the morning, to walk with an active
			step along the busy, sunny street, to work untiringly with his shipments
			of hammers and his cargoes of nails. It was in 1890 that he executed his
			famous business coup: he brought up the suggestion that all nails used in
			nailing up the boxes in which nails are shipped are the property of the shippee, a
			proposal which became a statute, was approved by Chief Justice Fossile,
			and saved Roger Button and Company, Wholesale Hardware, more
			than six hundred nails every year.

			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, Benjamin discovered that he was becoming more and
			more attracted by the gay side of life. It was typical of his growing enthusiasm
			for pleasure that he was the first man in the city of Baltimore to
			own and run an automobile. Meeting him on the street, his contemporaries
			would stare enviously at the picture he made of health and vitality.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"He seems to grow younger every year," they would remark. And if
			old Roger Button, now sixty&#8209;five years old, had failed at first to give a
			proper welcome to his son he atoned at last by bestowing on him what
			amounted to adulation.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;And here we come to an unpleasant subject which it will be well to
			pass over as quickly as possible. There was only one thing that worried
			Benjamin Button; his wife had ceased to attract him.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;At that time Hildegarde was a woman of thirty&#8209;five, with a son, Roscoe,
			fourteen years old. In the early days of their marriage Benjamin had
			worshipped her. But, as the years passed, her honey&#8209;colored hair became
			an unexciting brown, the blue enamel of her eyes assumed the aspect of
			cheap crockery&#8209;moreover, and, most of all, she had become too settled
			in her ways, too placid, too content, too anemic in her excitements, and too sober in her taste. As a bride it had been she who had "dragged" Benjamin
to dances and dinners&#8209;now conditions were reversed. She went
out socially with him, but without enthusiasm, devoured already by that
eternal inertia which comes to live with each of us one day and stays
with us to the end.
