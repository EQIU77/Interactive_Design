			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; There were no troublesome memories in his childish sleep; no token
			came to him of his brave days at college, of the glittering years when he
			flustered the hearts of many girls. There were only the white, safe walls
			of his crib and Nana and a man who came to see him sometimes, and a
			great big orange ball that Nana pointed at just before his twilight bed
			hour and called "sun." When the sun went his eyes were sleepy&#8209;there
			were no dreams, no dreams to haunt him.<br/>

			<p class="right">&nbsp; &nbsp;The past&#8209;the wild charge at the head of his men up San Juan Hill; the
			first years of his marriage when he worked late into the summer dusk
			down in the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he loved; the days
			before that when he sat smoking far into the night in the gloomy old Button
			house on Monroe Street with his grandfather&#8209;all these had faded
			like unsubstantial dreams from his mind as though they had never been.
