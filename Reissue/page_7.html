			then suddenly spoke in a cracked and ancient voice. "Are you my father?"
			he demanded.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Button and the nurse started violently.<br/>

			<p class="yellowright">  "Because if you are," went on the old man querulously, "I wish you'd
			get me out of this place&#8209;or, at least, get them to put a comfortable rocker
			in here,"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Where in God's name did you come from? Who are you?" burst out
			Mr. Button frantically.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I can't tell you exactly who I am," replied the querulous whine,
			"because I've only been born a few hours&#8209;but my last name is certainly
			Button."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"You lie! You're an impostor!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The old man turned wearily to the nurse. "Nice way to welcome a
			new-born child," he complained in a weak voice. "Tell him he's wrong,
			why don't you?"
