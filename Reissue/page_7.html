			&nbsp; &nbsp;The old man looked placidly from one to the other for a moment, and
			then suddenly spoke in a cracked and ancient voice. "Are you my father?"
			he demanded.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Button and the nurse started violently.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Because if you are," went on the old man querulously, "I wish you'd
			get me out of this place&#8209;or, at least, get them to put a comfortable rocker
			in here,"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Where in God's name did you come from? Who are you?" burst out
			Mr. Button frantically.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I can't tell you exactly who I am," replied the querulous whine,
			"because I've only been born a few hours&#8209;but my last name is certainly
			Button."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"You lie! You're an impostor!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The old man turned wearily to the nurse. "Nice way to welcome a
			new-born child," he complained in a weak voice. "Tell him he's wrong,
			why don't you?"
			</p>
			<p class="yellowright">  
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"You're wrong. Mr. Button," said the nurse severely. "This is your
			child, and you'll have to make the best of it. We're going to ask you to
			take him home with you as soon as possible&#8209;some time today." <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Home?" repeated Mr. Button incredulously.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, we can't have him here. We really can't, you know?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm right glad of it," whined the old man. "This is a fine place to keep
			a youngster of quiet tastes. With all this yelling and howling, I haven't
			been able to get a wink of sleep. I asked for something to eat"&#8209;here his
			voice rose to a shrill note of protest&#8209;"
			and they brought me a bottle of
			milk!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Button sank down upon a chair near his son and concealed his
			face in his hands. "My heavens!" he murmured, in an ecstasy of horror.
			"What will people say? What must I do?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"You'll have to take him home," insisted the nurse&#8209;"immediately!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;A grotesque picture formed itself with dreadful clarity before the eyes
			of the tortured man&#8209;a picture of himself walking through the crowded
			streets of the city with this appalling apparition stalking by his side. "I
			can't. I can't," he moaned.<br/>
