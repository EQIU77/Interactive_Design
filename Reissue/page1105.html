			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp;He loved to take a big cane from the hatrack and go around hitting
chairs and tables with it and saying: "Fight, fight, fight." When there
were people there the old ladies would cluck at him, which interested
him, and the young ladies would try to kiss him, which he submitted to
with mild boredom. And when the long day was done at five o'clock he
would go up&#8209;stairs with Nana and be fed oatmeal and nice soft mushy
foods with a spoon.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; There were no troublesome memories in his childish sleep; no token
			came to him of his brave days at college, of the glittering years when he
			flustered the hearts of many girls. There were only the white, safe walls
			of his crib and Nana and a man who came to see him sometimes, and a
			great big orange ball that Nana pointed at just before his twilight bed
			hour and called "sun." When the sun went his eyes were sleepy&#8209;there
			were no dreams, no dreams to haunt him.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The past&#8209;the wild charge at the head of his men up San Juan Hill; the
			first years of his marriage when he worked late into the summer dusk
			down in the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he loved; the days
			before that when he sat smoking far into the night in the gloomy old Button
			house on Monroe Street with his grandfather&#8209;all these had faded
			like unsubstantial dreams from his mind as though they had never been.
			<p class="right">
			&nbsp; &nbsp; He did not remember. He did not remember clearly whether the milk
			was warm or cool at his last feeding or how the days passed&#8209;there was
			only his crib and Nana's familiar presence. And then he remembered
			nothing. When he was hungry he cried&#8209;that was all. Through the noons
			and nights he breathed and over him there were soft mumblings and
			murmurings that he scarcely heard, and faintly differentiated smells, and
			light and darkness.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Then it was all dark, and his white crib and the dim faces that moved
			above him, and the warm sweet aroma of the milk, faded out altogether
			from his mind.
