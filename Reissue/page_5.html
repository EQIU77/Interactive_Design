			&nbsp; &nbsp; Clank! The basin clattered to the floor and rolled in the direction of the
			stairs. Clank! Clank! It began a methodical descent as if sharing in the
			general terror which this gentleman provoked.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I want to see my child!" Mr. Button almost shrieked. He was on the
			verge of collapse.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Clank! The basin had reached the first floor. The nurse regained control
			of herself, and threw Mr. Button a look of hearty contempt.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; "All right, Mr. Button," she agreed in a hushed voice. "Very well! But if
			you knew what a state it's put us all in this morning! It's perfectly outrageous!
			The hospital will never have the ghost of a reputation after&#8209;"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Hurry!" he cried hoarsely. "I can't stand this!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Come this way, then, Mr. Button."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;He dragged himself after her. At the end of a long hall they reached a
			room from which proceeded a variety of howls&#8209;indeed, a room which,
			in later parlance, would have been known as the "crying&#8209;room."
			</p>
			<p class="yellowright">  
They
			entered. Ranged around the walls were half a dozen white&#8209;enameled
			rolling cribs, each with a tag tied at the head. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well," gasped Mr. Button, "which is mine?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"There!" said the nurse.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Button's eyes followed her pointing finger, and this is what he
			saw. Wrapped in a voluminous white blanket, and partly crammed into
			one of the cribs, there sat an old man apparently about seventy years of
			age. <br/>
			His sparse hair was almost white, and from his chin dripped a long
			smoke&#8209;colored beard, which waved absurdly back and forth, fanned by
			the breeze coming in at the window. He looked up at Mr. Button with
			dim, faded eyes in which lurked a puzzled question.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Am I mad?" thundered Mr. Button, his terror resolving into rage. "Is
			this some ghastly hospital joke?<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"It doesn't seem like a joke to us," replied the nurse severely. "And I
			don't know whether you're mad or not, but that is most certainly your
			child."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The cool perspiration redoubled on Mr. Button's forehead. He closed
			his eyes, and then, opening them, looked again. There was no mistake&#8209;
			he was gazing at a man of threescore and ten&#8209;a baby of threescore
			and ten, a baby whose feet hung over the sides of the crib in which it was
			reposing.
