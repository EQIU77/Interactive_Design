			<p class="yellow"> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Is the child born?" begged Mr. Button.
			Doctor Keene frowned. "Why, yes, I suppose so&#8209;after a fashion."
			Again he threw a curious glance at Mr. Button.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is my wife all right?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it a boy or a girl?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Here now!" cried Doctor Keene in a perfect passion of irritation," I'll
			ask you to go and see for yourself. Outrageous!" He snapped the last
			word out in almost one syllable, then he turned away muttering: "Do
			you imagine a case like this will help my professional reputation? One
			more would ruin meâ€”ruin anybody." <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "What's the matter?" demanded Mr. Button appalled. "Triplets?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, not triplets!" answered the doctor cuttingly. "What's more, you
			can go and see for yourself. And get another doctor. I brought you into
			the world, young man, and I've been physician to your family for forty
			years, but I'm through with you! I don't want to see you or any of your
			relatives ever again! Goodbye!"<br/>
			</p>
			<p class="yellowright">  &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he turned sharply, and without another word climbed into his
			phaeton, which was waiting at the curbstone, and drove severely away.
			Mr. Button stood there upon the sidewalk, stupefied and trembling
			from head to foot.What horrible mishap had occurred? He had suddenly
			lost all desire to go into the Maryland Private Hospital for Ladies and
			Gentlemen. It was with the greatest difficulty that, a moment later, he
			forced himself to mount the steps and enter the front door. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; A nurse was sitting behind a desk in the opaque gloom of the hall.
			Swallowing his shame, Mr. Button approached her. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Good-morning," she remarked, looking up at him pleasantly.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Good-morning. I&#8209;I am Mr. Button."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; At this a look of utter terror spread itself over the girl's face. She rose
			to her feet and seemed about to fly from the hall, restraining herself only
			with the most apparent difficulty.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I want to see my child," said Mr. Button.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The nurse gave a little scream. "Oh&#8209;of course!" she cried hysterically.
			"Up&#8209;stairs. Right up&#8209;stairs. Go&#8209;up!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;She pointed the direction, and Mr. Button, bathed in a cool perspiration,
			turned falteringly, and began to mount to the second floor. In the
			upper hall he addressed another nurse who approached him, basin in
			hand. "I'm Mr. Button," he managed to articulate.
