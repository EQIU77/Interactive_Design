			&nbsp; &nbsp; Benjamin, once he left the hospital, took life as he found it. Several
			small boys were brought to see him, and he spent a stiff&#8209;jointed afternoon
			trying to work up an interest in tops and marblesâ€”he even managed,
			quite accidentally, to break a kitchen window with a stone from a
			sling shot, a feat which secretly delighted his father.<br/>


			&nbsp; &nbsp;Thereafter Benjamin contrived to break something every day, but he
			did these things only because they were expected of him, and because he
			was by nature obliging.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;When his grandfather's initial antagonism wore off, Benjamin and that
			gentleman took enormous pleasure in one another's company. They
			would sit for hours, these two, so far apart in age and experience, and,
			like old cronies, discuss with tireless monotony the slow events of the
			day. Benjamin felt more at ease in his grandfather's presence than in his
			parents'&#8209;they seemed always somewhat in awe of him and, despite the
			dictatorial authority they exercised over him, frequently addressed him
			as "Mr."

			&nbsp; &nbsp;He was as puzzled as any one else at the apparently advanced age of
			his mind and body at birth. He read up on it in the medical journal, but
			found that no such case had been previously recorded. At his father's urging
			he made an honest attempt to play with other boys, and frequently
			he joined in the milder games&#8209;football shook him up too much, and he
			feared that in case of a fracture his ancient bones would refuse to knit.<br/>

			&nbsp; &nbsp;When he was five he was sent to kindergarten, where he initiated into
			the art of pasting green paper on orange paper, of weaving colored maps
			and manufacturing eternal cardboard necklaces. He was inclined to
			drowse off to sleep in the middle of these tasks, a habit which both irritated
			and frightened his young teacher. To his relief she complained to his parents, and he was removed from the school. The Roger Buttons
			told their friends that they felt he was too young.<br/>
