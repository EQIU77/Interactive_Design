			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1920 Roscoe Button's first child was born. During the attendant festivities,
			however, no one thought it "the thing" to mention, that the little
			grubby boy, apparently about ten years of age who played around the
			house with lead soldiers and a miniature circus, was the new baby's own
			grandfather.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;No one disliked the little boy whose fresh, cheerful face was crossed
			with just a hint of sadness, but to Roscoe Button his presence was a
			source of torment. In the idiom of his generation Roscoe did not consider
			the matter "efficient." 
			It seemed to him that his father, in refusing to look
			sixty, had not behaved like a "red&#8209;blooded he&#8209;man"&#8209;this was Roscoe's
			favorite expression&#8209;but in a curious and perverse manner. Indeed, 
			think about the matter for as much as a half an hour drove him to the
			edge of insanity. Roscoe believed that "live wires" should keep young,
			but carrying it out on such a scale was&#8209;was&#8209;was inefficient. And there
			Roscoe rested. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Five years later Roscoe's little boy had grown old enough to play
			childish games with little Benjamin under the supervision of the same
			nurse. Roscoe took them both to kindergarten on the same day, and Benjamin
			found that playing with little strips of colored paper, making mats
			and chains and curious and beautiful designs, was the most fascinating
			game in the world. Once he was bad and had to stand in the
			corner&#8209;then he cried&#8209;but for the most part there were gay hours in the
			cheerful room, with the sunlight coming in the windows and Miss
			Bailey's kind hand resting for a moment now and then in his tousled
			hair.

			&nbsp; &nbsp;Roscoe's son moved up into the first grade after a year, but Benjamin
			stayed on in the kindergarten. He was very happy.<br/>
			Sometimes when other
			tots talked about what they would do when they grew up a shadow
			would cross his little face as if in a dim, childish way he realized that
			those were things in which he was never to share.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The days flowed on in monotonous content. He went back a third year
			to the kindergarten, but he was too little now to understand what the
			bright shining strips of paper were for. He cried because the other boys
			were bigger than he, and he was afraid of them. The teacher talked to
			him, but though he tried to understand he could not understand at all.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; He was taken from the kindergarten. His nurse, Nana, in her starched
gingham dress, became the centre of his tiny world. On bright days they
walked in the park; Nana would point at a great gray monster and say

"elephant," and Benjamin would say it after her, and when he was being
undressed for bed that night he would say it over and over aloud to her:
"Elyphant, elyphant, elyphant." Sometimes Nana let him jump on the
bed, which was fun, because if you sat down exactly right it would
bounce you up on your feet again, and if you said "Ah" for a long time
while you jumped you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect.
