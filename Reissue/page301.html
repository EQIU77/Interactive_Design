			&nbsp; &nbsp;Back at the hospital Mr. Button entered the nursery and almost threw
			the package at his son. "Here's your clothes," he snapped out.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"They look sort of funny to me," he complained, "I don't want to be
			made a monkey of&#8209;&#8209;"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "You've made a monkey of me!" retorted Mr. Button fiercely. "Never
			you mind how funny you look. Put them on&#8209;or I'll&#8209;or I'll spank you."
			He swallowed uneasily at the penultimate word, feeling nevertheless
			that it was the proper thing to say.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"All right, father"&#8209;this with a grotesque simulation of filial respect&#8209;"
			you've lived longer; you know best. Just as you say."
			</p>
			<p class="yellowright"> 
			&nbsp; &nbsp;As before, the sound of the word "father" caused Mr. Button to start violently.
			"And hurry."&#8209;respect&#8209;not to mention his position in Baltimore society.
			But a frantic inspection of the boys' department revealed no suits to fit
			the new&#8209;born Button. He blamed the store, of course&#8209;in such cases it is
			the thing to blame the store.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm hurrying, father."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;When his son was dressed Mr. Button regarded him with depression.
			The costume consisted of dotted socks, pink pants, and a belted blouse
			with a wide white collar. Over the latter waved the long whitish beard,
			drooping almost to the waist. The effect was not good.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Button seized a hospital shears and with three quick snaps amputated
			a large section of the beard. But even with this improvement the
			ensemble fell far short of perfection. The remaining brush of scraggly
			hair, the watery eyes, the ancient teeth, seemed oddly out of tone with
			the gayety of the costume. Mr. Button, however, was obdurate&#8209;he held
			out his hand. "Come along!" he said sternly.
