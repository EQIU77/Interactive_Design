			&nbsp; &nbsp; Even after the new addition to the Button family had had his hair cut
			short and then dyed to a sparse unnatural black, had had his face shaved
			so close that it glistened, and had been attired in small&#8209;boy clothes made
			to order by a flabbergasted tailor, it was impossible for Button to ignore
			the fact that his son was a poor excuse for a first family baby. Despite his
			aged stoop, Benjamin Button&#8209;for it was by this name they called him instead
			of by the appropriate but invidious Methuselah&#8209;was five feet
			eight inches tall. His clothes did not conceal this, nor did the clipping
			and dyeing of his eyebrows disguise the fact that the eyes under&#8209;were
			faded and watery and tired. In fact, the baby&#8209;nurse who had been engaged
			in advance left the house after one look, in a state of considerable
			indignation.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;But Mr. Button persisted in his unwavering purpose. Benjamin was a
			baby, and a baby he should remain. At first he declared that if Benjamin
			didn't like warm milk he could go without food altogether, but he was finally
			prevailed upon to allow his son bread and butter, and even oatmeal
			by way of a compromise. One day he brought home a rattle and,
			giving it to Benjamin, insisted in no uncertain terms that he should "play
			with it," whereupon the old man took it with a weary expression and
			could be heard jingling it obediently at intervals throughout the day.<br/>

			<p class="yellowright"> 
			&nbsp; &nbsp;There can be no doubt, though, that the rattle bored him, and that he
			found other and more soothing amusements when he was left alone. For
			instance, Mr. Button discovered one day that during the preceding week
			he had smoked more cigars than ever before&#8209;a phenomenon, which
			was explained a few days later when, entering the nursery unexpectedly,
			he found the room full of faint blue haze and Benjamin, with a guilty expression
			on his face, trying to conceal the butt of a dark Havana. This, of
			course, called for a severe spanking, but Mr. Button found that he could
			not bring himself to administer it. He merely warned his son that he
			would "stunt his growth."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Nevertheless he persisted in his attitude. He brought home lead soldiers,
			he brought toy trains, he brought large pleasant animals made of
			cotton, and, to perfect the illusion which he was creating&#8209;for himself at
			least&#8209;he passionately demanded of the clerk in the toy&#8209;store whether
			"the paint would come oft the pink duck if the baby put it in his mouth."
			But, despite all his father's efforts, Benjamin refused to be interested. He
			would steal down the back stairs and return to the nursery with a
			volume of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, over which he would pore<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;through an afternoon, while his cotton cows and his Noah's ark were left
			neglected on the floor. Against such a stubbornness Mr. Button's efforts
			were of little avail.<br/>
