			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Roscoe took them both to kindergarten on the same day, and Benjamin
			found that playing with little strips of colored paper, making mats
			and chains and curious and beautiful designs, was the most fascinating
			game in the world. Once he was bad and had to stand in the
			corner&#8209;then he cried&#8209;but for the most part there were gay hours in the
			cheerful room, with the sunlight coming in the windows and Miss
			Bailey's kind hand resting for a moment now and then in his tousled
			hair.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Roscoe's son moved up into the first grade after a year, but Benjamin
			stayed on in the kindergarten. He was very happy.  </p>
			<p class="right">Sometimes when other
			tots talked about what they would do when they grew up a shadow
			would cross his little face as if in a dim, childish way he realized that
			those were things in which he was never to share.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The days flowed on in monotonous content. He went back a third year
			to the kindergarten, but he was too little now to understand what the
			bright shining strips of paper were for. He cried because the other boys
			were bigger than he, and he was afraid of them. The teacher talked to
			him, but though he tried to understand he could not understand at all.
