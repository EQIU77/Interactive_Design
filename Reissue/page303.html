			&nbsp; &nbsp; By the time he was twelve years old his parents had grown used to
him. Indeed, so strong is the force of custom that they no longer felt that
he was different from any other child&#8209;except when some curious anomaly
reminded them of the fact. But one day a few weeks after his twelfth
birthday, while looking in the mirror, Benjamin made, or thought he
made, an astonishing discovery. Did his eyes deceive him, or had his
hair turned in the dozen years of his life from white to iron&#8209;gray under
its concealing dye? Was the network of wrinkles on his face becoming
less pronounced? Was his skin healthier and firmer, with even a touch of
ruddy winter color? He could not tell. He knew that he no longer
stooped, and that his physical condition had improved since the early
days of his life.

			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Can it be&#8209;?" he thought to himself, or, rather, scarcely dared to
think.

&nbsp; &nbsp;He went to his father. "I am grown," he announced determinedly. "I
want to put on long trousers."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;His father hesitated. "Well," he said finally, "I don't know. Fourteen is
the age for putting on long trousers&#8209;and you are only twelve."<br/>

			&nbsp; &nbsp;"But you'll have to admit," protested Benjamin, "that I'm big for my
age."<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;His father looked at him with illusory speculation. "Oh, I'm not so sure
of that," he said. "I was as big as you when I was twelve."<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;This was not true&#8209;it was all part of Roger Button's silent agreement
with himself to believe in his son's normality.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally a compromise was reached. Benjamin was to continue to dye
his hair. He was to make a better attempt to play with boys of his own
age. He was not to wear his spectacles or carry a cane in the street. In return
for these concessions he was allowed his first suit of long trousers.
