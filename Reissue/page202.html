			&nbsp; &nbsp; Back at the hospital Mr. Button entered the nursery and almost threw
the package at his son. "Here's your clothes," he snapped out.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The old man untied the package and viewed the contents with a quizzical
eye.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"They look sort of funny to me," he complained, "I don't want to be
made a monkey of&#8209;&#8209;"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"You've made a monkey of me!" retorted Mr. Button fiercely. "Never
you mind how funny you look. Put them on—or I'll—or I'll spank you."
He swallowed uneasily at the penultimate word, feeling nevertheless
that it was the proper thing to say.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"All right, father"&#8209;this with a grotesque simulation of filial respect&#8209;"
you've lived longer; you know best. Just as you say."<br/>
As before, the sound of the word "father" caused Mr. Button to start violently.
&nbsp; &nbsp;"And hurry."<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm hurrying, father."<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;When his son was dressed Mr. Button regarded him with depression.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The costume consisted of dotted socks, pink pants, and a belted blouse
with a wide white collar. Over the latter waved the long whitish beard,
drooping almost to the waist. The effect was not good.<br/>

			 </p>
			<p class="yellowright"> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Button seized a hospital shears and with three quick snaps amputated
			a large section of the beard. But even with this improvement the
			ensemble fell far short of perfection. The remaining brush of scraggly
			hair, the watery eyes, the ancient teeth, seemed oddly out of tone with
			the gayety of the costume. Mr. Button, however, was obdurate&#8209;he held
			out his hand. "Come along!" he said sternly.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;His son took the hand trustingly. "What are you going to call me,
			dad?" he quavered as they walked from the nursery&#8209;"just 'baby' for a
			while? till you think of a better name?"
			Mr. Button grunted. "I don't know," he answered harshly. "I think we'll
			call you Methuselah."
