			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; At the termination of this interview, Benjamin wandered dismally upstairs
			and stared at himself in the mirror. He had not shaved for three
			months, but he could find nothing on his face but a faint white down
			with which it seemed unnecessary to meddle. When he had first come
			home from Harvard, Roscoe had approached him with the proposition
			that he should wear eye-glasses and imitation whiskers glued to his
			cheeks, and it had seemed for a moment that the farce of his early years
			was to be repeated. But whiskers had itched and made him ashamed. He
			wept and Roscoe had reluctantly relented.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; Benjamin opened a book of boys' stories, "The Boy Scouts in Bimini
			Bay," and began to read. But he found himself thinking persistently
			about the war. America had joined the Allied cause during the preceding
			month, and Benjamin wanted to enlist, but, alas, sixteen was the minimum
			age, and he did not look that old. His true age, which was fifty-seven,
			would have disqualified him, anyway. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a knock at his door, and the butler appeared with a letter
			bearing a large official legend in the corner and addressed to Mr. Benjamin
			Button.</p>
			<p class="right"> 
			&nbsp; &nbsp; Benjamin tore it open eagerly, and read the enclosure with
			delight. It informed him that many reserve officers who had served in
			the Spanish&#8209;American War were being called back into service with a
			higher rank, and it enclosed his commission as brigadier-general in the
			United States army with orders to report immediately.<br/>
			Benjamin jumped to his feet fairly quivering with enthusiasm. This
			was what he had wanted. He seized his cap, and ten minutes later he
			had entered a large tailoring establishment on Charles Street, and asked
			in his uncertain treble to be measured for a uniform.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Want to play soldier, sonny?" demanded a clerk casually. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin flushed. "Say! Never mind what I want!" he retorted angrily.
			"My name's Button and I live on Mt. Vernon Place, so you know I'm
			good for it."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," admitted the clerk hesitantly, "if you're not, I guess your daddy
			is, all right."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin was measured, and a week later his uniform was completed.
			He had difficulty in obtaining the proper general's insignia because the
			dealer kept insisting to Benjamin that a nice Y. W. C. A. badge would
			look just as well and be much more fun to play with.
