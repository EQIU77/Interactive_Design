			&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the life of Benjamin Button between his twelfth and twenty&#8209;first year I
			intend to say little. Suffice to record that they were years of normal ungrowth.
			When Benjamin was eighteen he was erect as a man of fifty; he
			had more hair and it was of a dark gray; his step was firm, his voice had
			lost its cracked quaver and descended to a healthy baritone. So his father
			sent him up to Connecticut to take examinations for entrance to Yale College.
			Benjamin passed his examination and became a member of the
			freshman class.
			<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;On the third day following his matriculation he received a notification
			from Mr. Hart, the college registrar, to call at his office and arrange his
			schedule. Benjamin, glancing in the mirror, decided that his hair needed
			a new application of its brown dye, but an anxious inspection of his bureau
			drawer disclosed that the dye bottle was not there. Then he remembered&#8209;
			he had emptied it the day before and thrown it away.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;He was in a dilemma. He was due at the registrar's in five minutes.
			There seemed to be no help for it&#8209;he must go as he was. He did.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Good&#8209;morning," said the registrar politely. "You've come to inquire
			about your son."<br/>

			</p>
			<p class="yellowright"> 
			
			
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Why, as a matter of fact, my name's Button&#8209;" began Benjamin, but
			Mr. Hart cut him off.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Button. I'm expecting your son here
			any minute."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"That's me!" burst out Benjamin. "I'm a freshman."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"What!"
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm a freshman."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Not at all."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The registrar frowned and glanced at a card before him. "Why, I have
			Mr. Benjamin Button's age down here as eighteen."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"That's my age," asserted Benjamin, flushing slightly.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The registrar eyed him wearily. "Now surely, Mr. Button, you don't expect
			me to believe that."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin smiled wearily. "I am eighteen," he repeated.<br/>
			T&nbsp; &nbsp;he registrar pointed sternly to the door. "Get out," he said. "Get out of
			college and get out of town. You are a dangerous lunatic."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I am eighteen."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Hart opened the door. "The idea!" he shouted. "A man of your age
			trying to enter here as a freshman. Eighteen years old, are you? Well, I'll
			give you eighteen minutes to get out of town."
