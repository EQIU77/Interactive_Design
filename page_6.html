			<p class="yellow"> They
			entered. Ranged around the walls were half a dozen white&#8209;enameled
			rolling cribs, each with a tag tied at the head. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well," gasped Mr. Button, "which is mine?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"There!" said the nurse.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Button's eyes followed her pointing finger, and this is what he
			saw. Wrapped in a voluminous white blanket, and partly crammed into
			one of the cribs, there sat an old man apparently about seventy years of
			age. <br/>

			</p>
			<p class="yellowright">  His sparse hair was almost white, and from his chin dripped a long
			smoke&#8209;colored beard, which waved absurdly back and forth, fanned by
			the breeze coming in at the window. He looked up at Mr. Button with
			dim, faded eyes in which lurked a puzzled question.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Am I mad?" thundered Mr. Button, his terror resolving into rage. "Is
			this some ghastly hospital joke?<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"It doesn't seem like a joke to us," replied the nurse severely. "And I
			don't know whether you're mad or not, but that is most certainly your
			child."
