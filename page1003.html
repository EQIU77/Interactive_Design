			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Saying nothing to Roscoe, he left the house one night and proceeded
			by train to Camp Mosby, in South Carolina, where he was to command
			25
			an infantry brigade. On a sultry April day he approached the entrance to
			the camp, paid off the taxicab which had brought him from the station,
			and turned to the sentry on guard.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Get some one to handle my luggage!" he said briskly.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The sentry eyed him reproachfully. "Say," he remarked, "where you
			goin' with the general's duds, sonny?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin, veteran of the Spanish-American War, whirled upon him
			with fire in his eye, but with, alas, a changing treble voice.
			</p>
			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Come to attention!" he tried to thunder; he paused for breath&#8209;then
			suddenly he saw the sentry snap his heels together and bring his rifle to
			the present. Benjamin concealed a smile of gratification, but when he
			glanced around his smile faded. It was not he who had inspired obedience,
			but an imposing artillery colonel who was approaching on
			horseback.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Colonel!" called Benjamin shrilly.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The colonel came up, drew rein, and looked coolly down at him with a
			twinkle in his eyes. "Whose little boy are you?" he demanded kindly.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I'll soon darn well show you whose little boy I am!" retorted Benjamin
			in a ferocious voice. "Get down off that horse!"
