			&nbsp; &nbsp; One September day in 1910—a few years after Roger Button &amp;Co.,
			Wholesale Hardware, had been handed over to young Roscoe Button—a
			man, apparently about twenty years old, entered himself as a freshman
			at Harvard University in Cambridge. He did not make the mistake of announcing
			that he would never see fifty again, nor did he mention the fact
			that his son had been graduated from the same institution ten years
			before.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;He was admitted, and almost immediately attained a prominent position
			in the class, partly because he seemed a little older than the other
			freshmen, whose average age was about eighteen.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;But his success was largely due to the fact that in the football game
			with Yale he played so brilliantly, with so much dash and with such a
			cold, remorseless anger that he scored seven touchdowns and fourteen
			field goals for Harvard, and caused one entire eleven of Yale men to be
			carried singly from the field, unconscious. He was the most celebrated
			man in college.

			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp;Strange to say, in his third or junior year he was scarcely able to
			"make" the team. The coaches said that he had lost weight, and it seemed
			to the more observant among them that he was not quite as tall as before.
			He made no touchdowns—indeed, he was retained on the team chiefly
			in hope that his enormous reputation would bring terror and disorganisation
			to the Yale team.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;In his senior year he did not make the team at all. He had grown so
			slight and frail that one day he was taken by some sophomores for a
			freshman, an incident which humiliated him terribly. He became known
			as something of a prodigy&#8209;a senior who was surely no more than sixteen &#8209;
			and he was often shocked at the worldliness of some of his classmates.
			His studies seemed harder to him—he felt that they were too advanced.
			He had heard his classmates speak of St. Midas', the famous preparatory
			school, at which so many of them had prepared for college, and
			he determined after his graduation to enter himself at St. Midas', where
			the sheltered life among boys his own size would be more congenial to
			him.
