			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; On the September morning consecrated to the enormous event he
			arose nervously at six o'clock, dressed himself, adjusted an impeccable
			stock, and hurried forth through the streets of Baltimore to the hospital,
			to determine whether the darkness of the night had borne in new life
			upon its bosom. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; When he was approximately a hundred yards from the Maryland
			Private Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen he saw Doctor Keene, the
			family physician, descending the front steps, rubbing his hands together
			with a washing movementâ€”as all doctors are required to do by the unwritten
			ethics of their profession.</p>
			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Roger Button, the president of Roger Button &amp;Co., Wholesale
			Hardware, began to run toward Doctor Keene with much less dignity
			than was expected from a Southern gentleman of that picturesque period.<br/>
			"Doctor Keene!" he called. "Oh, Doctor Keene!"
			The doctor heard him, faced around, and stood waiting, a curious expression
			settling on his harsh, medicinal face as Mr. Button drew near.<br/>
			"What happened?" demanded Mr. Button, as he came up in a gasping
			rush. <br/>
			"What was it? How is she? A boy? Who is it? What&#8209;&#8209;" <br/>
			"Talk sense!" said Doctor Keene sharply, He appeared somewhat
			irritated.
