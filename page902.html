			&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his graduation in 1914 he went home to Baltimore with his Harvard
			diploma in his pocket. Hildegarde was now residing in Italy, so
			Benjamin went to live with his son, Roscoe. But though he was welcomed
			in a general way there was obviously no heartiness in Roscoe's
			feeling toward him&#8209;there was even perceptible a tendency on his son's
			23
			part to think that Benjamin, as he moped about the house in adolescent
			mooniness, was somewhat in the way. Roscoe was married now and
			prominent in Baltimore life, and he wanted no scandal to creep out in
			connection with his family.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin, no longer persona grata with the débutantes and younger
			college set, found himself left much alone, except for the companionship
			of three or four fifteen&#8209;year&#8209;old boys in the neighborhood. His idea of
			going to St. Midas school recurred to him.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Say," he said to Roscoe one day, "I've told you over and over that I
			want to go to prep school."
			</p>
			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, go, then," replied Roscoe shortly. The matter was distasteful to
			him, and he wished to avoid a discussion.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I can't go alone," said Benjamin helplessly. "You'll have to enter me
			and take me up there."<br/>

			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I haven't got time," declared Roscoe abruptly. His eyes narrowed and
			he looked uneasily at his father. "As a matter of fact," he added, "you'd
			better not go on with this business much longer. You better pull up
			short. You better&#8209;you better"&#8209;he paused and his face crimsoned as he
			sought for words&#8209;"you better turn right around and start back the other
			way. This has gone too far to be a joke. It isn't funny any longer.
			You&#8209;you behave yourself!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin looked at him, on the verge of tears.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"And another thing," continued Roscoe, "when visitors are in the
			house I want you to call me 'Uncle'&#8209;not 'Roscoe,' but 'Uncle,' do you understand?
			It looks absurd for a boy of fifteen to call me by my first name.
			Perhaps you'd better call me 'Uncle' all the time, so you'll get used to it."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;With a harsh look at his father, Roscoe turned away… .
