			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; The colonel roared with laughter.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"You want him, eh, general?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Here!" cried Benjamin desperately. "Read this." And he thrust his
			commission toward the colonel.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;The colonel read it, his eyes popping from their sockets.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Where'd you get this?" he demanded, slipping the document into his
			own pocket.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I got it from the Government, as you'll soon find out!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"You come along with me," said the colonel with a peculiar look. "We'll
			go up to headquarters and talk this over. Come along."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;

			</p>
			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp; The colonel turned and began walking his horse in the direction of
			headquarters. There was nothing for Benjamin to do but follow with as
			much dignity as possible&#8209;meanwhile promising himself a stern
			revenge.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;But this revenge did not materialize. Two days later, however, his son
			Roscoe materialized from Baltimore, hot and cross from a hasty trip, and
			escorted the weeping general, sans uniform, back to his home.
