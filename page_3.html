			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Is the child born?" begged Mr. Button.
			Doctor Keene frowned. "Why, yes, I suppose so&#8209;after a fashion."
			Again he threw a curious glance at Mr. Button.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is my wife all right?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it a boy or a girl?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "Here now!" cried Doctor Keene in a perfect passion of irritation," I'll
			ask you to go and see for yourself. Outrageous!" He snapped the last
			word out in almost one syllable, then he turned away muttering: "Do
			you imagine a case like this will help my professional reputation? One
			more would ruin meâ€”ruin anybody." </p>
			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp; "What's the matter?" demanded Mr. Button appalled. "Triplets?"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, not triplets!" answered the doctor cuttingly. "What's more, you
			can go and see for yourself. And get another doctor. I brought you into
			the world, young man, and I've been physician to your family for forty
			years, but I'm through with you! I don't want to see you or any of your
			relatives ever again! Goodbye!"<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; Then he turned sharply, and without another word climbed into his
			phaeton, which was waiting at the curbstone, and drove severely away.
			Mr. Button stood there upon the sidewalk, stupefied and trembling
			from head to foot.
