			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; As long ago as 1860 it was the proper thing to be born at home. Atpresent, so I am told, the high gods of medicine have decreed that the first cries of the young shall be uttered upon the anesthetic air of a hospital, preferably a fashionable one. So young Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button
			were fifty years ahead of style when they decided, one day in the summer of 1860, that their first baby should be born in a hospital. Whether this anachronism had any bearing upon the astonishing history I am
			about to set down will never be known.
			I shall tell you what occurred, and let you judge for yourself.</p>
			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Roger Buttons held an enviable position, both social and financial,
			in ante-bellum Baltimore. They were related to the This Family and the
			That Family, which, as every Southerner knew, entitled them to membership
			in that enormous peerage which largely populated the Confederacy.
			This was their first experience with the charming old custom of having
			babies. Mr. Button was naturally nervous. He hoped it would be a boy
			so that he could be sent to Yale College in Connecticut, at which institution Mr. Button himself had been known for four years by the somewhat obvious nickname of "Cuff."
