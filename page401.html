			&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the life of Benjamin Button between his twelfth and twenty&#8209;first year I
			intend to say little. Suffice to record that they were years of normal ungrowth.
			When Benjamin was eighteen he was erect as a man of fifty; he
			had more hair and it was of a dark gray; his step was firm, his voice had
			lost its cracked quaver and descended to a healthy baritone. So his father
			sent him up to Connecticut to take examinations for entrance to Yale College.
			Benjamin passed his examination and became a member of the
			freshman class.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;On the third day following his matriculation he received a notification
			from Mr. Hart, the college registrar, to call at his office and arrange his
			schedule.Benjamin, glancing in the


			</p>
			<p class="yellowright"> mirror, decided that his hair needed
			a new application of its brown dye, but an anxious inspection of his bureau
			drawer disclosed that the dye bottle was not there. Then he remembered&#8209;
			he had emptied it the day before and thrown it away.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;He was in a dilemma. He was due at the registrar's in five minutes.
			There seemed to be no help for it&#8209;he must go as he was. He did.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Good&#8209;morning," said the registrar politely. "You've come to inquire
			about your son."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Why, as a matter of fact, my name's Button&#8209;" began Benjamin, but
			Mr. Hart cut him off.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Button. I'm expecting your son here
			any minute."
