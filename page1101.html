			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1920 Roscoe Button's first child was born. During the attendant festivities,
			however, no one thought it "the thing" to mention, that the little
			grubby boy, apparently about ten years of age who played around the
			house with lead soldiers and a miniature circus, was the new baby's own
			grandfather.<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;No one disliked the little boy whose fresh, cheerful face was crossed
			with just a hint of sadness, but to Roscoe Button his presence was a
			source of torment. In the idiom of his generation Roscoe did not consider
			the matter "efficient." </p>
			<p class="right">It seemed to him that his father, in refusing to look
			sixty, had not behaved like a "red&#8209;blooded he&#8209;man"&#8209;this was Roscoe's
			favorite expression&#8209;but in a curious and perverse manner. Indeed, 
			think about the matter for as much as a half an hour drove him to the
			edge of insanity. Roscoe believed that "live wires" should keep young,
			but carrying it out on such a scale was&#8209;was&#8209;was inefficient. And there
			Roscoe rested. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Five years later Roscoe's little boy had grown old enough to play
			childish games with little Benjamin under the supervision of the same
			nurse.
