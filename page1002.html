			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Benjamin tore it open eagerly, and read the enclosure with
			delight. It informed him that many reserve officers who had served in
			the Spanish&#8209;American War were being called back into service with a
			higher rank, and it enclosed his commission as brigadier-general in the
			United States army with orders to report immediately.<br/>
			Benjamin jumped to his feet fairly quivering with enthusiasm. This
			was what he had wanted. He seized his cap, and ten minutes later he
			had entered a large tailoring establishment on Charles Street, and asked
			in his uncertain treble to be measured for a uniform.</p>
			<p class="right"> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Want to play soldier, sonny?" demanded a clerk casually. <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin flushed. "Say! Never mind what I want!" he retorted angrily.
			"My name's Button and I live on Mt. Vernon Place, so you know I'm
			good for it."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," admitted the clerk hesitantly, "if you're not, I guess your daddy
			is, all right."<br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin was measured, and a week later his uniform was completed.
			He had difficulty in obtaining the proper general's insignia because the
			dealer kept insisting to Benjamin that a nice Y. W. C. A. badge would
			look just as well and be much more fun to play with.
