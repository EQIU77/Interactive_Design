			<p class="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; He was taken from the kindergarten. His nurse, Nana, in her starched
gingham dress, became the centre of his tiny world. On bright days they
walked in the park; Nana would point at a great gray monster and say

"elephant," and Benjamin would say it after her, and when he was being
undressed for bed that night he would say it over and over aloud to her:
"Elyphant, elyphant, elyphant." Sometimes Nana let him jump on the
bed, which was fun, because if you sat down exactly right it would
bounce you up on your feet again, and if you said "Ah" for a long time
while you jumped you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect.<br/>

chairs and tables with it and saying: "Fight, fight, fight." When there
were people there the old ladies would cluck at him, which interested
him, and the young ladies would try to kiss him, which he submitted to
with mild boredom. And when the long day was done at five o'clock he
would go up&#8209;stairs with Nana and be fed oatmeal and nice soft mushy
foods with a spoon.
